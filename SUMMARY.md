**Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography** is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry, and in the medical research. 

The dataset consists of 3103 images with 3577 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*abnormal_structure*). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2458 images) and *test* (645 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 View: ***mlo*** (1643 images) and ***cc*** (1460 images), or into 2 case: ***mass*** (1592 images) and ***calcification*** (1511 images), or into 2 Breast: ***left*** (1592 images) and ***right*** (1511 images), or into 3 pathology: ***malignant*** (1367 images), ***benign*** (1336 images), and ***benign_without_callback*** (400 images), or into 6 BI-RADS assessment: ***assessment:4*** (1544 images), ***assessment:5*** (532 images), ***assessment:3*** (429 images), ***assessment:2*** (357 images), ***assessment:0*** (239 images), and ***assessment:1*** (2 images). Also dataset includes ***calc_type***, ***calc_distribution***, ***mass_shape***, ***mass_margins***, ***breast_density***, ***subtlety***, ***patient_id*** tags. The dataset was released in 2017 by the Stanford University.
