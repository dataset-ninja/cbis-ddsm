**CBIS-DDSM: Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography** is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 3103 images with 3577 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*abnormal_structure*).

Images in the CBIS-DDSM dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2458 images) and *test* (645 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 cases: ***mass*** (1592 images) and ***calcification*** (1511 images), or into 2 views: ***mlo*** (1643 images) and ***cc*** (1460 images), or into 2 breasts: ***left*** (1592 images) and ***right*** (1511 images), or into 3 pathologies: ***malignant*** (1367 images), ***benign*** (1336 images), and ***benign_without_callback*** (400 images), or into 6 BI-RADS assessments: ***assessment:4*** (1544 images), ***assessment:5*** (532 images), ***assessment:3*** (429 images), ***assessment:2*** (357 images), ***assessment:0*** (239 images), and ***assessment:1*** (2 images). Also, dataset includes ***calc_type***, ***calc_distribution***, ***mass_shape***, ***mass_margins***, ***breast_density***, ***subtlety***, ***patient_id*** tags. The dataset was released in 2017 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Stanford University</span>.
